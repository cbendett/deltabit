# deltabit

Welcome to Deltabit! Deltabit is tool designed for detecting clusters of horizontally transferred genes in genomes. It's still a work in progress, but check back for updates! Deltabit was originally designed for the purpose of detecting _Starships_, giant horizontally-transferring transposons in fungi, though it isn't limited to this use case.
